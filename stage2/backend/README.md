# 📦 Inventory Management System – Stage 2 (Backend)

This is the backend for a scalable Inventory Management System tailored for kiryana (small retail) stores. In **Stage 2**, we introduced authentication, API enhancements, and implemented clean architecture to ensure maintainability, security, and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** for store login and protected routes
- 🧠 **API Client** for centralized `axios` config (frontend support)
- 🏬 Store-specific **Product & Stock Management**
- 📊 **Stock Movements** tracked in detail (In, Out, Manual)
- 📁 **MVC Architecture** for clean and modular codebase
- ⚡ **Rate Limiter & Caching** to enhance performance
- ✅ Secure, token-based access control
- 🔍 Structured data via **MySQL relational database**

---

## 🗃️ Database Schema

The backend uses MySQL with the following tables:

- `Stores`: Info about each kiryana store
- `Categories`: Product categories
- `Products`: Store products with categories
- `Store_Stock`: Tracks product quantities for each store
- `Stock_Movements`: Logs all stock-in, out, and manual removals
- ✅ `store_id` is used for authentication context

---

## 🔐 Authentication (JWT)

- **Login API** returns a JWT token.
- Pass token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected routes.
- Middleware ensures only authenticated store owners can access critical endpoints.
